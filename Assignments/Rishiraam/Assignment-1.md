# Rishi - Task 1: UI Layout & Structure

I built the main layout using **Streamlit**, organizing the interface into clear sections â€” including input fields for topic, tone, keywords, and word count. The two-column layout (as seen in the screenshot) makes the app intuitive to navigate. I also used custom HTML and Markdown to add visual polish, like the colored headings and icons that help guide the user.
